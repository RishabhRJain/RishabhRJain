### Hello! I am Rishabh Jain 

I work as a Data Scientist at Moveworks. I started my career in 2017 as a software developer at Nokia and after working for a while found that I was
interested in Data Science. Soon enough, I started learning DS/ML on my own.  I liked the  ambiguous nature of problems and how to creatively solve problems and to move forward even when there's some uncertainity. In 2020, I joined ASU to do my master's in computer science with a focus on Data Science based courses. I worked as a Research assistant at one of the labs and worked on solving interesting problem of identifying at-risk students in undergrad courses at ASU using Machine learning. The first version of models went live in just 3 months. After the first pilot, the student passing % improved by 10% which was a huge accomplishment for me and my team. My team also published a paper around that. (Link - https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-78270-2_22)

Since this year, I have been working at Moveworks as a DS working on improving metrics to reflect business impact, performing experiments to improve the model which resulted in around 15% savings for customers. I love the fast paced culture and a sense of ownership on the projects I am working on. Also my background as SDE helps me to write production level code and work end-to-end involving Engineeering as well, Overall, I am looking for a exciting and challenging role where I can grow in my career. 

I learn to make machines learn. I love trekking, calisthenics, ultimate frisbee and basketball. My cover photo is from a trek in Himalayas.
